Middleware:
==========
.Flow:
1.React calls Action Creator
2.Action creator returns an action
3.Action will be sent to Middleware
4.Middleware will forwards actions to Reducers
5.Reducers produces new State and sent it to React Component

* Middleware has opportunity to log, stop, modify, or not touch an action
* We can have multiple middlewares, we don't have a number of limit

*Async middleware:
1.action send a state
2. does the action contain a promise?
3.1 No, i don't care about it, send it to the next middleware,
3.1.1 Yes, cool let's sit around and wait for it to resolve
4. Resolved! heres the data create a new action and send it through all the middlewares again,
but with the data as payload, not the promise.
